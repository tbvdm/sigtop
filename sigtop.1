.Sh NAME
.Nm sigtop
.Nd export messages from Signal Desktop
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sigtop
.Ar command
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility to export messages, attachments and other data from Signal
Desktop.
.Pp
.Nm
needs access to the directory where Signal Desktop stores its data.
By default,
.Nm
tries the following locations:
.Bl -tag -width "Windows"
.It Windows
.Pa %AppData%\eSignal
.It macOS
.Pa "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Signal"
.It Unix
.Pa $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Signal ,
or
.Pa $HOME/.config/Signal
if
.Ev XDG_CONFIG_HOME
is unset or empty.
If neither directory exists,
.Nm
tries the locations used by the unofficial Snap and Flatpak versions of Signal
Desktop.
These locations are
.Pa $HOME/snap/signal-desktop/current/.config/Signal
and
.Pa $HOME/.var/app/org.signal.Signal/config/Signal ,
respectively.
.El
.Pp
A different location for the Signal Desktop directory can be specified using
the
.Fl d
option (see below).
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.Tg check
.It Ic check-database Op Fl d Ar signal-directory
.D1 Pq Alias: Ic check
.Pp
Check the integrity of the encrypted Signal Desktop database.
The check is performed using the SQLite/SQLCipher
.Cm cipher_integrity_check ,
.Cm integrity_check
and
.Cm foreign_key_check
pragmas.
.Tg att
.It Xo
.Ic export-attachments
.Op Fl iLlMm
.Op Fl d Ar signal-directory
.Op Fl s Ar interval
.Op Ar directory
.Xc
.D1 Pq Alias: Ic att
.Pp
Export attachments.
The attachment files are created in separate directories, one for each
conversation.
These directories are created in
.Ar directory ,
or in the current directory if
.Ar directory
is not specified.
.Pp
Signal Desktop stores attachments in unencrypted files.
.Nm
can copy these files, or create hard links or symbolic links to them.
By default, attachments are copied.
If the
.Fl L
option is specified, hard links are created.
If the
.Fl l
option is specified, symbolic links are created.
.Pp
The
.Fl M
option may be used to set the file modification time of each attachment to the
time it was sent.
The
.Fl m
option is similar, but uses the time the attachment was received.
These options are ignored if
.Fl L
is also specified.
.Pp
By default, all attachments are exported.
If the
.Fl i
option is specified, an incremental export is performed.
This means that only new attachments are exported; attachments that were
exported in a previous run are skipped.
The
.Pa .incremental
file in
.Pa directory
is used to keep track of exported attachments.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option may be used to export only the attachments that were sent in the
specified time interval.
See the
.Sx TIME INTERVALS
section below for details.
.Tg db
.It Ic export-database Oo Fl d Ar signal-directory Oc Ar file
.D1 Pq Alias: Ic db
.Pp
Decrypt and export the Signal Desktop database to
.Ar file .
The exported database is a regular SQLite database.
.Tg msg
.It Xo
.Ic export-messages
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl d Ar signal-directory
.Op Fl f Ar format
.Op Fl s Ar interval
.Op Ar directory
.Xc
.D1 Pq Alias: Ic msg
.Pp
Export messages.
The messages are written to separate files, one for each conversation.
These files are created in
.Ar directory ,
or in the current directory if
.Ar directory
is not specified.
.Pp
The
.Fl f
option may be used to specify the output format.
The following output formats are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm json
Messages are written in JSON format.
The JSON data is copied directly from the Signal Desktop database, so its
structure may differ between Signal Desktop versions.
.It Cm text
Messages are written as plain text.
This is the default.
.El
.Pp
By default,
existing files in
.Pa directory
are not overwritten.
If the
.Fl i
option is specified, an incremental export is performed.
This means that existing conversation files are updated.
.Pp
By default, all messages are exported.
The
.Fl s
option may be used to export only the messages that were sent in the specified
time interval.
See the
.Sx TIME INTERVALS
section below details.
.El
.Sh TIME INTERVALS
A time interval is specified using the format
.Sm off
.Sq Oo Ar time Oc Cm \&, Oo Ar time Oc ,
.Sm on
and a time is specified using the format
.Sm off
.Sq Ar yyyy Cm - Ar mm Cm - Ar dd Cm T Ar hh Cm \&: Ar mm Cm \&: Ar ss .
.Sm on
The endpoints of the interval are inclusive, and either endpoint may be
omitted.
